                <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa </li>
                <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota, thanks<br>to a
                Depression era program known as the "National Youth Administration" </li>
                <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian<br> 
                Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed them", <br>
                he said. "All of this left scars on me." </li>
                <li> 1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
                <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget cuts.<br>
                Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who<br>
                teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants. </li>
                <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is<br>
                rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT<br>
                to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science. </li>
                <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
                <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant<br>
                wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. Over the next<br>
                16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - <br>
                including different varieties for each major climate on Earth. </li>
                <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields </li>
                <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling<br>
                American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes<br>
                on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat. </li>
                <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to<br>
                the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to<br>
                a rapidly expanding population </li>
                <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize </li>
                <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and<br>
                sorghum yields </li>
                <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University </li>
                <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."<br>
                Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the<br>
                demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently<br>
                dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for<br>
                a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting<br>
                the best breeds." </li>
                <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95. </li>
